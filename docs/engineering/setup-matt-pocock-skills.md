## What it does

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` records three facts about one repo: where issues live, what the triage labels are called, and where the domain docs sit. It writes those facts as markdown files under `docs/agents/`.

Those files are the only thing that varies between repos. The skills themselves are identical everywhere; they read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` at run time and do what it says. That is why the set is not tied to GitHub, and why no skill file ever needs editing to point it somewhere else.

It runs **yolo**. It does not interview. It derives the recommended defaults from the repo, writes them, and reports what it did, so you adjust by editing the files rather than answering a questionnaire.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`; the [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) won't reach for it on its own. It is deliberately marked non-invokable, so no other skill can fire it for you.

Reach for it once per repo, before the first use of any other engineering skill. If [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) or [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) start guessing where your issues go, or apply labels your tracker doesn't have, they have not been set up here yet. A repo already halfway through a project is a fine place to run it; the skill reads what is already there and no earlier work is wasted.

## Prerequisites

It writes into the repo you run it in:

| It writes | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `issue-tracker.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `domain.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `triage-labels.md` | `docs/agents/`, only when the `triage` skill is installed |
| An `## Agent skills` block | whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` already exists, or a new `AGENTS.md` if neither does |

All of it is committed markdown. There is no user-level or global mode: the config lives in the repo, so every repo gets its own copy.

## What it derives

Three values, each taken from the repo rather than from a prompt:

| Decision | What it writes |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue tracker** | the host in `git remote`: GitHub, GitLab, or local markdown if there is no matching remote |
| **Triage labels** | the five canonical names (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`), and only if the `triage` skill is installed |
| **Domain docs** | single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the root. Multi-context (`CONTEXT-MAP.md`) only when it spots monorepo signals |

The tracker options:

| Option | Where issues live | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | the repo's GitHub Issues | the `gh` CLI |
| **GitLab** | the repo's GitLab Issues | the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI |
| **Local markdown** | files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo | nothing: no remote at all |

The three ship as templates in the skill and work out of the box. Local markdown is a first-class option, not a fallback: a solo project with no remote is fully supported. One caveat is worth repeating: don't use local markdown if you're using GitHub. They are alternatives, not layers.

A Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps, or Beads tracker is a later edit to `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Downstream skills follow whatever prose is in that file, which is how those trackers already work in the wild: a Jira-over-[MCP](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/mcp) variant, a Gitea CLI shaped like `gh`, a hand-built local dashboard.

## Common questions

**Do I have to use GitHub?**

No. GitHub, GitLab and local markdown under `.scratch/` all ship as ready-made templates. Anything else works by replacing `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` after the run. This is the most-repeated question in the record, in roughly these words: *"hard locked to github"*, *"can I use GitLab / Jira"*, *"what about Azure DevOps"*. The answer every time is that the tracker is a setup answer, not a skill property.

**Do I need to re-run it after updating the skills?**

The skill's closing message says re-running is only needed to switch trackers or start over. The seed templates also change between versions, so a `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` written by an older release can go stale against the skills now reading it. If a downstream skill starts doing something the docs describe differently, re-running is the cheap fix.

**It wrote to `CLAUDE.md`, but I'm on Codex.**

Known gap, still open. The file-selection rule is "edit `CLAUDE.md` if it exists, else `AGENTS.md`": it checks which file exists, not which [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) is running. A repo with a `CLAUDE.md` left over from Claude Code will get its `## Agent skills` block somewhere Codex never reads. Two workarounds are in circulation: move the block to `AGENTS.md` by hand, or keep `AGENTS.md` canonical and make `CLAUDE.md` a one-line pointer at it. If neither file exists, the skill creates `AGENTS.md`.

**It didn't create my triage labels.**

It doesn't. `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` is a *mapping*: it tells `/triage` which strings in your tracker correspond to the five canonical roles. It does not run `gh label create`. On a fresh GitHub repo the labels genuinely do not exist yet, and this has been filed as a bug more than once. Two follow-ons:

- If your tracker already uses the canonical names, the mapping is an identity table and there is nothing to configure. That is the intended common case, not a missing step.
- [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder)'s `wayfinder:map` and `wayfinder:<type>` labels are not created here either, and `gh issue create --label <missing>` fails outright rather than creating the label. Create them by hand before the first wayfinder run on a GitHub repo.

**Can I configure the other skills' behaviour here ([grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling) cadence, question format, tone)?**

No. It configures three things: tracker, labels, doc layout. There have been direct requests to make it the home for per-user preferences, and the standing answer is that skills stay opinionated: *"Config is death."* Preferences belong in your `CLAUDE.md` as plain instructions, which every skill already reads.

**Can I keep the config in `~/.claude` instead of committing it to every repo?**

Not today. There is an open request for exactly this from someone running the skills across many repos, and no user-level mode exists. Every repo carries its own `docs/agents/`.

**Isn't it strange to have a skill that configures the other skills?**

One long-standing complaint says yes, in these words: *"having a skill to set up the other skill does not feel right to me: that means the LLM is configuring its own skills."* The trade is real and acknowledged: the alternative to a setup step is duplicating tracker instructions into every skill that touches issues. The output is inspectable, editable markdown, which is the mitigation: you can read every file it wrote and change it by hand, and day-to-day tweaks are exactly that, not another run.

## It's working if

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md` exist, plus `triage-labels.md` if `triage` is installed.
- An `## Agent skills` section appears in the instruction file your harness actually reads, with a one-line summary pointing at each of those files.
- The tracker it wrote matches the remote you really use, and the label strings match labels that really exist in your tracker.
- The run reports what it derived instead of waiting for confirmation.
- Afterwards, `/to-tickets` publishes without asking you where issues live, and `/triage` applies labels rather than inventing them.
- Nothing in the skill files themselves changed. If setup edited a `SKILL.md`, something went wrong.

## Where it fits

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` is the **run-once setup** for the engineering flow, the precondition everything else assumes rather than a step in the chain. Its neighbours are its readers: [triage](https://aihero.dev/skills-triage), which applies the label vocabulary written here; [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec) and [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which publish into the tracker named here; and [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder), which reads the "Wayfinding operations" section of the same tracker file to know how maps and child [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket) are stored. The domain-doc layout it records is the one [domain-modeling](https://aihero.dev/skills-domain-modeling) fills in later: it creates `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs lazily, when a term or decision actually gets resolved, so an empty repo after setup is the expected state. For which skill to reach for next, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes the whole set.
